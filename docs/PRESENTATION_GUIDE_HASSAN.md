# Presentation Guide — Hassan Alloush

[Full team guide](PRESENTATION_GUIDE.md)

# 1. Project Overview

Mystery Room — The Case Archive is a browser game with two Arabic stories and an
English interface. Players choose a case, read clues, submit answers, and solve
three stages to unlock an ending.

B4F Hub is the bootcamp teaching project for community posts and opportunities.
Mystery Room applies its programming patterns to a different product. It does not
call Hub's services or share its data. Removing Mystery Room would not break Hub.

| Part | Current implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend: the browser interface | React, TypeScript for code checking, React Router for navigation |
| Development tool | Vite serves the client and forwards /api requests to Express |
| Backend: the request-handling program | JavaScript runs in Node.js; Express maps requests to functions |
| API: the communication contract | GET reads data, POST submits answers, PATCH requests hints |
| Data format | JSON: text representing objects, arrays, and simple values |
| Database and ORM | None. An ORM is a database-mapping tool; we do not use one |
| Authentication: identity checking | None. There are no accounts, passwords, tokens, or login sessions |
| Runtime storage | One in-memory server store, shared by connected browsers |
| Persistence | Browser refresh keeps server progress; server restart resets it |

HTTP is the request/response protocol between client and server. A proxy forwards
requests: during development, Vite forwards /api to localhost:3001. Normal npm start
in server does not serve the React production bundle.

## Team responsibilities and evidence

This is a guide to the **current integrated working tree**, including uncommitted
changes. Your latest role list defines presentation responsibilities; it does not
prove who wrote every line. Shared-file authorship is not invented.

| Member | Presentation area | Important limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shiam Ezzo | Pages, routes, and layout | AppRouter, AboutPage, and separate Header files are absent |
| Hassan Alloush | API helpers, public types, and feedback | Current files are flat api.ts/types.ts, not the proposed folders |
| Mulham Al Kasir (Molham) | Existing page-local state and game flow | Earlier page work exists; assigned Context/Redux files are absent |
| Adham Albasha | Game components and results | Supplied components were merged and adapted |
| Hamid Al Haj | First mystery and shared backend overview | First-case ownership is user-confirmed; shared-file split is unclear |
| Ali Mikdad | Second mystery and validation behavior | Second-case ownership is user-confirmed; shared-file split is unclear |

Shiam and Mulham discuss overlapping pages from different angles: navigation versus
state and requests. This is a speaking plan, not an exclusive authorship assignment.
Later integration fixes, tests, and new reveal text are not automatically credited
to the original puzzle authors.

# 2. Team Member Section

## Hassan Alloush – API Helpers, Types, and Feedback

### 2.1 High-Level Summary

This area provides a clear connection between the interface and the server. Named helper functions hide repeated request details from the pages. TypeScript types describe the public data the client expects. Shared loading, error, and empty messages explain what is happening to the player.

### 2.2 Files They Worked On

These are the current files for this presentation area. Shared or comparison files
are not proof of individual authorship; missing assignments are noted below.

| File Path | Purpose | Key Functions/Classes/Components |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [client/src/api.ts](<../client/src/api.ts>) | Makes requests and converts failed responses into errors | apiRequest, getMysteries, getMysteryById, getClues, submitAnswer, requestHint |
| [client/src/types.ts](<../client/src/types.ts>) | Describes public request results | Mystery, Clue, AnswerResponse, HintResponse |
| [client/src/components/LoadingMessage.tsx](<../client/src/components/LoadingMessage.tsx>) | Announces loading | LoadingMessage |
| [client/src/components/ErrorMessage.tsx](<../client/src/components/ErrorMessage.tsx>) | Displays an error and optional retry action | ErrorMessage |
| [client/src/components/EmptyState.tsx](<../client/src/components/EmptyState.tsx>) | Explains an empty collection | EmptyState |

### 2.3 Code Walkthrough

1. A page calls a helper, such as `getMysteryById(id)`.
2. `apiRequest<T>` sends `fetch` to `/api/mysteries` plus the endpoint path. `T` is the expected TypeScript result type.
3. The helper checks `response.ok`. On failure it uses the server's error string when possible, otherwise a fallback, and throws an `Error`.
4. Successful JSON returns to the page. The page owns loading/error state and decides what to render.
5. `submitAnswer` sends POST with a JSON `{answer}` body. `requestHint` sends PATCH. IDs are escaped with `encodeURIComponent` when constructing paths.
6. `ErrorMessage` calls the retry function supplied by the page; it does not force a browser reload. Loading and error messages use accessible status/alert roles.

`Mystery` exposes current progress, available options, and hint counts, but not the accepted answer list. `reveal` is null before completion. A wrong answer is a successful HTTP response with `correct: false`, not a network exception.

### 2.4 Key Concepts to Learn

**API.** An API is the agreed way two parts of a program communicate. Here it consists of HTTP endpoints and JSON response shapes.

**Promise and await.** A Promise represents work that finishes later. `await` lets a function wait for a request result while the browser remains able to render.

**TypeScript type.** A type describes allowed data during development. It does not inspect the actual server JSON at runtime; `as T` is not validation.

**HTTP status.** A status code tells the client how a request was handled. The client must check it because fetch does not automatically throw for every 400 or 404 response.

### 2.5 Connection to B4F Hub

Compare [Hub API helpers](<../../../B4F-BootCamp/b4f-cohort8-salamiyah-react-node-bootcamp-2026/client/src/api.ts>) and [Hub types](<../../../B4F-BootCamp/b4f-cohort8-salamiyah-react-node-bootcamp-2026/client/src/types.ts>). Both centralize requests and data descriptions, and both have reusable feedback components. No Hub endpoint or type is imported by Mystery Room; without this layer our own pages lose their normal request/error path.

### 2.6 Connection to b4f-cohort8 Docs

- [Session 5 study guide](<../../../B4F-BootCamp/b4f-cohort8-salamiyah-react-node-bootcamp-2026/docs/Sessions/session-05/SESSION_GUIDE-EN.pdf>): Sections 5–9 trace a request, explain HTTP, and connect fetch to a real backend.
- [Session 6 study guide](<../../../B4F-BootCamp/b4f-cohort8-salamiyah-react-node-bootcamp-2026/docs/Sessions/session-06/SESSION_GUIDE-EN.pdf>): Sections 3–4 describe input validation and deliberate status codes. Backend checks remain necessary even when the client has types.

### 2.7 Presentation Talking Points

- Start: “Pages call named functions instead of repeating fetch details.”
- Trace `getMysteryById` from a page into `apiRequest`.
- Show `Mystery` and explain why private answers are absent.
- Demonstrate a missing ID and the retry interface.
- Do not say TypeScript validates network data or that every wrong answer is an HTTP error.

### 2.8 Expected Questions & Answers

| Question | Simple Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Why centralize requests? | The base path and error handling have one owner. |
| Does fetch throw on 404? | Not automatically; apiRequest checks response.ok. |
| Why use encodeURIComponent? | It safely places the ID text into a URL path. |
| Are the proposed api/types folders present? | No. This implementation uses the flat files api.ts and types.ts. |

### 2.9 Glossary for This Member

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| JSON | A text format for structured data. |
| Endpoint | An API address with a supported method. |
| Generic type | A type parameter such as T, supplied for a particular use. |
| Callback | A function passed to another component to run later. |

**Scope and attribution:** TODO: need confirmation — the proposed split into api/client.ts, api/mysteryApi.ts and four types files is not present. Explain the current flat structure without claiming those files exist.

# 3. Cross-Team Integration

Shiam explains the screens and addresses. Mulham explains temporary page state.
Adham explains the display components. Hassan explains the API helpers and types.
Hamid and Ali explain the shared server and their respective stories.

```mermaid

  participant Player
  participant Page as Pages and local state
  participant UI as Game components
  participant Helper as api.ts
  participant Server as Express controller
  participant Store as Runtime store
  Player->>Page: Open a mystery by ID
  Page->>Helper: getMysteryById and getClues
  Helper->>Server: GET requests

  Server->>Store: Validate, update if correct
  Server-->>Page: correct and message through helper
  Page->>Helper: GET latest state after success
  Page->>UI: Next stage or final ResultCard
```

B4F Hub is **outside** this runtime sequence. There are no shared imports, API
endpoints, database tables, or cross-project events. It provides the study examples.

| Boundary | Agreement |
| --- | --- |
| Page to component | Props: values/functions passed from parent to child |
| Component to page | Callbacks: functions called when the player acts |
| Page to API helper | Named functions, not fetch calls scattered through components |
| API to backend | JSON bodies and deliberate HTTP status codes |
| Backend to page | Zero-based currentStage, hintsRemaining, reveal:null until solved |
| Seed to runtime | One mutable store; accepted answers stay private |

Important differences from Hub: our missing-mystery helper throws rather than
returning null; seeds are deep-copied; Express setup is in app.js; basic JSON-parser
error handling was added during integration. Session 6 discusses error middleware
conceptually, but its Hub example did not implement that handler. Do not describe
our additions as exact code taught in that session.

# 4. Presentation Day Checklist

## Before the talk

- Open this guide, the project, and two terminals in server and client.
- Run npm install (or npm ci) separately in both directories before presentation day.
- Start server with npm start and client with npm run dev. Use Vite's printed URL.
- Do not start a second backend on an occupied port. The default API port is 3001.
- Restart the dedicated demo backend before a fresh demonstration; this clears progress.
- Check client npm run build, client npm run lint, and server npm test beforehand.
- Confirm each speaker's role and review story wording as a team.

## Suggested six-minute order

| Speaker | Time | Have open | Show |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hamid | 45 sec | Home and first-case data | Team, product, player goal |
| Shiam | 45 sec | App.tsx and browser | Home to archive to details; ID in URL |
| Mulham | 60 sec | GamePage.tsx | Input state, wrong attempt, server progression |
| Adham | 75 sec | AnswerOptions and ResultCard | Clue/hint controls; final reveal |
| Hassan | 60 sec | api.ts, types.ts, ErrorMessage | Request flow and recovery |
| Ali | 75 sec | Second-case data and tests | Free text, validation, challenge and improvement |

This is a proposed speaking order, not a claim of code authorship. The assignment
asks for a 5–7 minute English product presentation, not a reading of every file.

## Demo sequence

1. Start at Home and explain the player goal in one sentence.
2. Open case 1. Choose iron to demonstrate a wrong guess without progression.
3. Show clues and request one hint. Explain the three-request budget per case.
4. Solve the case, show the actual ending and statistics, and refresh the result.
5. Open case 2 to show the text-input branch if time allows.
6. Explain a real challenge: a server can accept an answer before its response is lost.
7. Explain the recovery: GET current progress before making another change.

<details>
<summary>Presenter answer key — spoilers</summary>

- Case 1: brass → 42 → 12.
- Case 2: قاف → يلعب الشطرنج → ١٠ (or 10).
- These are preparation notes, not answers embedded in the client.

</details>

## Backup plan

- If the interface or API fails, inspect the relevant terminal and show the recovery state honestly.
- If already solved, restart only the dedicated demo backend, not an unrelated process.
- Use previously captured screenshots or test output as backup, clearly labelled prior evidence.
- Run npm test in server to show independent API behavior. Its isolated process does not reset the live demo server.
- Avoid package upgrades or new installs during the talk.

Independent failure examples in PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3001/api/mysteries/1/answers -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{}'
curl.exe -i http://localhost:3001/api/mysteries/999
```

The first intentionally returns 400; the second returns 404. Neither solves a stage.

# 5. Final Notes

## Facts and limits

- The current source and supplied B4F reference files are the evidence for this guide.
- The project specification permits local state and does not require Redux or Context.
- Hamid's first-case and Ali's second-case ownership comes from the user's confirmation.
- A source folder named molham does not prove Molham authored every file inside it.
- Tests and browser checks recorded in CODE-WALKTHROUGH.md are previous verification evidence. This documentation-only task does not claim a fresh application test run.
- Contributions must be supported by actual work and history, not generated attribution.

## Open questions retained without blocking this draft

- **TODO: need confirmation** — will Shiam's AppRouter, Header, and About files arrive later, or are the current equivalents final?
- **TODO: need confirmation** — does Hassan have another api/types implementation, or are the flat modules the agreed version?
- **TODO: need confirmation** — is existing local-state/page work Mulham's final speaking topic, or will he supply Context/Redux files?
- **TODO: need confirmation** — how do Hamid and Ali divide the shared server files?
- **TODO: need confirmation** — who should receive credit for later reveal wording, integration fixes, and tests?
- **TODO: need confirmation** — confirm the speaking order, real Git contributions, and story originality as a team.
- **TODO: need confirmation** — PROJECT-SPEC-EN.pdf refers to PRESENTATION-GUIDE-EN.md, but that separate document was not found in the supplied docs. Timing here follows the specification's own sections 18–21.

No missing feature is presented as implemented. No database, authentication, theme
switch, language switch, game slice, or live Hub integration is claimed.
